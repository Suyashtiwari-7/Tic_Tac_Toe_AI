# 🎮 AI-Based Tic Tac Toe Game using Minimax (Python + Tkinter)

This is a graphical Tic Tac Toe game where a human player competes against an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play optimally in "Hard" mode, with adjustable difficulty levels ("Easy", "Normal", "Hard"). The game is built using **Python** and the **Tkinter GUI toolkit**.

## 🧠 Features

- 🤖 **AI Opponent** with Minimax Algorithm
- 🎚️ **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy** – Random moves
  - **Normal** – 70% optimal + 30% random
  - **Hard** – Fully optimal using Minimax
- 🖱️ **Interactive GUI** built with Tkinter
- 🔁 **Restart Button** to reset the board anytime
- 🚫 Prevents invalid moves and ends game correctly
- 📦 Fully standalone, no external dependencies required

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions

- You play as **"X"**, and the AI plays as **"O"**
- Click any empty cell to make your move
- Choose the difficulty level (**Easy / Normal / Hard**) from the buttons below the board
- Click **"Restart"** to begin a new game

## ⚙️ AI Logic – Minimax Algorithm

- In **Hard** mode, the AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to calculate the best possible move by exploring all potential game states
- In **Normal** mode, the AI mixes optimal and random behavior for a more human-like experience
- In **Easy** mode, the AI makes purely random moves
